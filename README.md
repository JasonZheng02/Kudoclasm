## Description
This website aims to portray data about happiness across the globe in an interactive and unique way. While data may be portrayed according to location by country, this is not indicative of a causation or correlation between geography and one's personal happiness. Each country also shows the factors contributing to their Happiness Score and the amount of impact each has on their total score.
